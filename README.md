## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This is Coursera data science capstone project. I was interestested in using venue information of Manhattan neighborhoods together with neighborhood retail and apartment rental price data to better understand:

1. Which venue information in Manhattan neighborhoods are related to pet stores?
2. What are the relationship between venue information and pet store?
3. How to predict the number of potential new pet store in each neighborhood?
4. If Manhattan neighborhoods are grouped into clusters based on pet store related features, does
   validate the prediction results?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There are ... data files used in the notebook. "..." is the data file for... .

The data can be aquired at [Foursqucare](https://foursquare.com/) with valid user account.

## Results <a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code is ....
